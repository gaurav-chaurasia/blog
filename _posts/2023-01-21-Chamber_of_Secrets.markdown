Hey there 👋, What a great day to start something new, this is something I have been meaning to start for a long time 😩; I don't know if anyone would be interested in reading this, but if you do, just an FYI- I suck at English & I am a terrible writer 😭 so please don't complain about it. It's on you 😂.
I am also really good at coming up with fake scenarios in my head so maybe that could be interesting in coming posts 😂, or if you are techy, then you might like a few things which I am planning to write about 🤫.

      



This is my `Chamber of Secrets`, a fancy name, right? Yeah, I know I stole it from Harry Potter 😩 but in simpler words, This is just me talking to myself about myself and obviously some techy stuff, you know; after procrastinating this so damn long, I am finally going to write down this one, I have been thinking about writing✍️ down my thought for so long as writing your thought, ideas, experiences can help you in so many ways in your overall development also not to mention channeling your thoughts from your mind to a piece of paper through your hands is not that easy as it looks like.

      



This has been in my bucket since the moment someone very special left me; I still remember that day when I came back from school and saw that she had already left me without saying a word to me; she is the one whom I used to tell everything, she is in my every single childhood memory, It has been eight years, ten months, and 28 days from today, but I still miss her every single day. 

Wait wait wait ..... Don't worry; this isn't a sad story 😂; I needed to mention her here as she is the one because of whom. I am, who I am and will always be grateful to her. 
But now, back to the point, no more procrastination; now is the time to let it all out and focus on things that matter.



     

I already have a lot of topics that I might be writing about in the near future or studying or just exploring for fun; some are related to my hobbies which are from learning about the cosmos to exploring new techs like how to use Nginx for reverse proxy or how Casandra makes distributed databases a child's play, or how entire concept of cloud works which is kinda my thing right now and of course, this chamber of secrete wouldn't be a chamber of secrets if I don't mention any of my cringe activity 😂(just a heads up, this might include about my first crush to my first drink ... the list goes on 😭), not to mention my professional life.
